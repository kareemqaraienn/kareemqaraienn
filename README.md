<h1 align="center">Hi there! I'm Kareem👋 </h1>

A computer science and mathematics graduate from the University of Ottawa 🎓, specializing in AI and machine learning 🤖. I have a strong background in data science and software development, with experience in managing and analyzing business data 📊, designing websites with ReactJS 🌐, and developing AI algorithms.

My latest role was as an AI Software Developer at Ross Video, where I had the privilege of creating the autofocus algorithm, a critical component in our product lineup. I took ownership of this project, leading its development from concept to implementation. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that allowed me to leverage my computer vision skills in C++ and OpenCV.

In addition to my professional work, I'm also passionate about personal projects. My current project is MobileDoc, a website that utilizes AI to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. MobileDoc offers a range of features, including user authentication via cookies, a history of predicted diseases, and comprehensive disease information. I'm excited about the potential impact of this project on healthcare.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations in the tech industry, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me at kareemqaraeen@gmail.com 📩. Let's connect on GitHub! 💻
