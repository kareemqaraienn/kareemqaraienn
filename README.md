<h1 align="center">Hi there! I'm Kareem👋 </h1>

A computer science and mathematics student at the University of Ottawa 🎓 with a passion for AI and machine learning 🤖. When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me working on my personal project Freng 📈. It's an NLP tool that uses magic 🧙‍♂️ (well, actually Python) to transforming any messy CSV file into a clear and concise English word frequency chart. Whether it's dealing with copied HTML, bolded text, font names, or highlights - Freng takes care of the dirty work, so you don't have to!


I've also had some amazing experiences in the tech industry, including a data scientist internship at Statistics Canada, where I flexed my Python and SQL muscles to manage business data 📊, and a software engineering internship at the University of Ottawa, where I designed a slick website using ReactJS 🌐.

I'm always on the lookout for exciting new opportunities in tech, so feel free to reach out to me at kareemqaraeen@gmail.com 📩. And hey, let's connect on GitHub! 💻
